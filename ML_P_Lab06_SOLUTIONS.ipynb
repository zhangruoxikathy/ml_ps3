    "## Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a method for estimating sampling distributions of an estimator by resampling with replacement form the original sample. It is a flexible way to quantify uncertainty associated with an estimator or a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use bootstrapping to estimate hard to calculate standard errors (or confidence intervals). It is also used when the population is too small to generate a large sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the latter, bootstrapping is especially useful because it allows us to mimic the process of selecting many observations from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, we will use the following terminology when referring to the samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Sample:** The one sample of size `n` we have from the population\n",
    "- **Subsample:** We draw `B` subsamples (of size `n`) with replacement from the original sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap algorithm goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain the original sample from the population\n",
    "2. Draw a subsample from the original sample\n",
    "3. Compute the estimate ($ \\hat{\\alpha}_{b}^{*} $) from the subsample\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 `B` times\n",
    "5. Compute $ SE_{B}(\\hat{\\alpha}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B-1} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} (\\hat{\\alpha}_{b}^{*} - \\bar{\\alpha}_{b}^{*})^{2}} $ where $ \\bar{\\alpha}_{b}^{*} = \\frac{\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\hat{\\alpha}_{b}^{*}}{B}$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bootstrap Algorithm](bootstrap_algorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the bootstrap is that we approximate the real distribution in the population by the original sample. This of course relies on the distribution in the original sample to approximate the population (which increases with n).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to overstate the importance of the bootstrap. As Efron and Hastie write, “Bootstrap confidence intervals are neither exact nor optimal, but aim instead for a wide applicability, combined with near-exact accuracy”.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is of course the debate about how many bootstrap replications, B, we should use. Ideally, an infinite amount but that is not feasible because of computational restraints. Therefore, we will settle for “as many as possible”.\n"

    "\n",
    "To do this, we will get randomly get the indices of `n` observations with replacement from the original sample. This means that an index can appear 0, 1, or multiple times in our subsample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we could also directly draw a subsample (i.e., make a dataframe) but we decided to do it with indices here and build the dataframe only when we need it in the `boot_fn` function."
